## Business Problems

1. What are the total sales, profits, and order volumes?
2. Which states and cities contribute the highest sales and revenue?
3. Which product categories and sub-categories are top performers?
4. How does the monthly profit trend throughout the year?
5. Which payment modes are most commonly used by customers?
6. Who are the top customers based on purchase value?
7. Which sub-categories bring in the most profit?
8. How do different regions perform in terms of sales and profit?
9. Are there specific months with profit dips or losses?
10. Is there a mismatch between order volume and profit contribution?

## Process
